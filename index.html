        <h1>BEN INVERNO</h1>
        <div id="aboutcontent"><h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Hey there! My name is Benjamin Inverno. I am currently 20 years old, born and raised in Melbourne, Australia. I am currently undergoing a Bachelor of Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne. I've had an interest in computers and IT since a very young age. My first memories of using a computer was using Paint to draw pictures of houses when I was 5 years old. Since then they have become a big area of interest in my life.<img id="food" src="test.jpg"></p>
            <p>For the past three years (on and off) i've been teaching myself programming in my spare time. I thoroughly enjoy writing in Python (most of my projects are in Python) and more recently creating webpages and working with Javascript.</p><img id="bencoop" src="bencoop.jpg">
            <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy playing videogames (I've been playing League of Legends, Rocket League and Overwatch for a while) and reading in my spare time. We also have two cats and a dog that I love to play with!</p>
            <p>I currently work at McDonalds, and have been working there on and off for the past 4 years. I'm always looking for an opportunity to jump into the Information Technology industry, especially while i'm studying, and I have a big interest speccifically in cloud computing. </p></div>
